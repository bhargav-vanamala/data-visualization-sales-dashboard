## Key Insights
- Sales exhibit seasonal patterns with month-to-month fluctuations.
- West and East regions generate the highest revenue, but some regions show lower profit margins.

- A small number of sub-categories drive a significant portion of revenue.
- High sales do not always translate to high profit due to discounting.
